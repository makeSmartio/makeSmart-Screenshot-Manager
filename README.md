This SwiftUI code should be working and ready to run and deploy locally. I will be publishing this to the macOS App Store when it is ready (sandbox permission issues!)

The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for viewing your screenshots and searching for text within them. 

This code uses the Apple Vision Framework to extract text from images and modifies the com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment extended file attribute of image files to make the text searchable with Spotlight and Finder. 

This took me a couple of days using ChatGPT and Claude. Thanks to the developers to have shared their code before me to make this so easy.
